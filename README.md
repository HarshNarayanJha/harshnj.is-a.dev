Nuxt project for my personal website.

This is just the repo for source.
Actual website is hosted using github in the repo [harshnarayanjha.github.io](https://github.com/HarshNarayanJha/harshnarayanjha.github.io/)

To build to a static site

```
bun run generate
```

I upload the build in `dist` to that repo's `rennovate/nuxtjs` branch and gh-pages uses this branch to publish on my custom domain.
